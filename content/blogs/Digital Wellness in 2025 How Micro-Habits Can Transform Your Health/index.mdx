## Why this matters

By 2025, average adults spend 6–8 hours daily on connected screens. Effects: sleep disruption, fragmented focus, eye strain.  
[Harvard Health](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/blue-light-has-a-dark-side) links blue light to melatonin suppression.  
The [American Optometric Association](https://www.aoa.org/) promotes the 20-20-20 rule to reduce strain.

## What is digital wellness?

It’s **intentional use of tech**. Not anti-tech — but mindful: using devices when helpful, pausing when harmful.  

---

## 9 micro-habits (with how-to guides)

### 1) Notification Audit
**Action:** Disable non-essential push alerts.  
**Why:** Every ping hijacks focus.

---

### 2) 20-20-20 Rule
Every 20 mins → look 20 feet away → 20 seconds.  
Proven to reduce headaches and strain.  

---

### 3) Phone-Free Morning
Delay phone checks for 30 minutes. Start with hydration/stretching.  
Result: calmer mornings, higher focus.  

---

### 4) Digital Sunset
No screens 1 hour before bed. Swap scrolling for journaling.  
[Harvard Health](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/blue-light-has-a-dark-side) confirms improved sleep.

### 5) Mindful Scroll
Ask: *“Am I opening this app intentionally?”*  
If not, close it. Breaks autopilot use.

---

### 6) Workspace Reset
Put phone in drawer during deep work.  
Results: fewer interruptions, higher output.  

---

### 7) Digital Sabbath
Try 12–24 hours offline weekly. Studies show improved mood, lower stress.

---

### 8) Micro-Breaks
Every hour → stretch/walk 2 minutes.

> “Small wins compound. A 30-min phone delay = a month of calmer mornings.”
